This app focuses on experimenting with the filesystem, displaying images on screen and layouts in landscape and portrait mode.

## Progress

- All images and buttons present on screen
- Theme song now played when clicked on main heading
- Individual soundbites added to main buttons
- Extra soundbites added, random soundbite played when button is pressed
